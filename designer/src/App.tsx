   * The restore half of `SCH_EDITOR_CONTROL::Revert`
   * (eeschema/tools/sch_editor_control.cpp:487-491):
   *
   *     SCH_SCREENS screenList( schematic.Root() );
   *     for( … ) screen->SetContentModified( false );   // do not prompt
   *     m_frame->ReleaseFile();
   *     m_frame->OpenProjectFiles( { schematic.GetFileName() }, KICTL_REVERT );
   *
   * Upstream that is a re-read of the FILE, because KiCad touches disk only
   * when you press Save, so the file IS the last saved version. We autosave
   * continuously, so our equivalent of "the last version saved" is the newest
   * `kind: 'save'` Local History point — which is a real one only because saves
   * now record one (see saveProjectFiles). Reverting to the file here would be
   * a no-op that merely LOOKED destructive.
   *
   * Returns false when there is nothing to revert to, so the caller can say so
   * instead of silently doing nothing.
   *
   * Setting the project files is the `OpenProjectFiles` half: the editors
   * reload from `initialProject` whenever it changes.
