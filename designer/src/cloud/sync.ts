/**
 * Two-way project sync between IndexedDB (local) and the cloud.
 *
 * Strategy: **fast-forward on a version integer**, over the union of local and
 * cloud ids. Individual saves and deletes also mirror up while online (see
 * HomePage), so this full pass mainly matters at first sign-in on a new device.
 *
 * ### Why not last-write-wins on a timestamp
 *
 * It used to be exactly that, and the timestamp was `Date.now()` **from the
 * browser** — written into `projects.updated_at` and compared against another
 * machine's clock as if the two were one. A device a minute slow lost every
 * race regardless of what actually happened first, and the *contents* were never
 * consulted at all. Since opening a project rewrites its files (identical bytes,
 * fresh timestamp), the last tab to merely open a project won, and could
 * overwrite a different machine's real work.
 *
 * Now every row carries a `version` the server assigns, and a push states the
 * version it is replacing. Three cases, and they are git's:
 *
 *  - **base === cloud, no local change** — already in sync, do nothing.
 *  - **base === cloud, local changed** — fast-forward: push over that version.
 *  - **base < cloud** — the cloud moved. Pull. If this side *also* changed, that
 *    is a genuine conflict, and only then is the local copy forked aside.
 *
 * No clock takes part in any of it, and "changed" means the blob hashes differ.
 *
 * ### Failures are reported, not counted as success
 *
 * Every transfer used to be gathered into one `Promise.all`, whose rejection
 * the caller logged to the console and then displayed "✓ Projects synced"
 * anyway. Nothing a user could see distinguished a clean sync from one where
 * every project failed — which is how a fault that emptied eleven projects ran
 * for weeks without a report.
 *
 * So a per-project failure is now caught, kept, and returned. One project
 * failing no longer abandons the rest, and the caller receives a list it is
 * expected to show.
 *
 * Known limitation, unchanged: a delete made offline can be resurrected by the
 * other side on the next sync (no tombstones yet). Deletes while online
 * propagate fine.
