/**
 * The cloud half of project persistence, as a commit protocol.
 *
 * ### What went wrong before
 *
 * A push used to upload each blob to a mutable path, ignore whether any of
 * those uploads succeeded, and then rewrite the row to list file *names* only —
 * discarding the inline copies that were, at that moment, the only ones left.
 * A pull turned a failed download into `gzB64: ''` and wrote the resulting
 * empty record over the local one, which the sync layer then marked as agreed.
 * Eleven of fourteen projects in one browser were reduced to a list of file
 * names with no contents, and nothing anywhere reported an error.
 *
 * ### The protocol now
 *
 * Two rules, both borrowed from systems that do not lose data:
 *
 * **Content-addressed storage.** Blobs are keyed by the hash of their bytes
 * (`blobStore.ts`), so a write can only add and a read can be verified.
 *
 * **The commit is last, and it is the only mutation.** Every blob is stored and
 * then *confirmed present* before the row is written. Until that row lands, the
 * previous version is entirely intact; if anything fails, it stays that way and
 * the error propagates. A row can therefore never reference a blob that is not
 * in the store — the invariant the old design had no way to state, let alone
 * hold.
 *
 * Everything here runs against the {@link CloudBackend} interface, so the
 * failure paths are reachable from tests. They were not before, which is the
 * real reason the bugs survived.
