 * VITE_DEMOS_URL points at it (Cloudflare R2, same pattern as the 3D model
 * library; build the upload tree with tools/demos/build.mjs). Opening a demo
 * fetches its files verbatim (no renaming, a demo opens as itself).
 *
 * **A demo arrives whole.** It used to hold back .step/.stp/.wrl/.glb/.pdf/.bin
 * - 40.7 MB of the CM5 demo's 46 - and fetch them later, because 89 separate
 * requests made anything else unaffordable. The bundle removed the reason:
 * the whole project is one object now, so there is nothing to defer and no
 * second fetch to stall the user mid-edit. It also puts those files in the
 * project tree, where KiCad has them all along - `s_allowedExtensionsToList`
 * lists `.pdf` (project_tree_pane.cpp:266), and a deferred file was not in the
 * file list for the tree to show.
