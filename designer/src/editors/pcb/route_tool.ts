 * What the Route Single Track tool decides when the cursor moves.
 * Counterpart: `ROUTER_TOOL`'s posture handling plus the walkaround it runs
 * over the result.
 *
 * Extracted from `PcbEditor.tsx` so it can be tested. It was the last untested
 * link in the router chain — hulls, chain operations, walkaround and its driver
 * all have suites of their own, and the glue that decides *when to use them*
 * had none, because the qa package cannot import a `.tsx`. That is exactly the
 * seam where a chain of individually-correct pieces goes wrong, and it is worth
 * saying that the same gap is how the bug fixed in #372 survived two PRs.
 *
 * There is no rendering here, and no board mutation: given where the route
 * starts, where the cursor is, and what is on the board, this says which points
 * the track should pass through. The component draws that as a preview and
 * commits the same list on click, so what is previewed and what is committed
 * cannot drift.

 * ## Falling back is a feature
 *
 * When no clear route exists the direct path is returned rather than nothing.
 * That is upstream's `MARK_OBSTACLES` behaviour and the right default for a
 * tool that only suggests geometry: a track the user can see and DRC will flag
 * beats a tool that silently refuses to draw. A router that goes blank when the
 * board gets tight is one people stop trusting.
 *
 * The same fallback covers the cheap exits — no clearance configured, nothing
 * on the layer to avoid — so there is one answer for "avoidance did not apply"
 * rather than three.
 *
 * ## The walk is tidied before it is returned
 *
 * Walkaround's output is correct and is not what anybody would draw: it hugs
 * every hull it passes, tracing octagon corners that stop mattering the moment
 * the path is clear of them, so a route past three vias arrives as twenty
 * points. `optimize` takes that back to the few corners a person would have
 * used. It is the last step rather than a separate command because the user
 * never wants the untidied version — upstream optimises as part of placing.
 *
 * The collision test handed to it is `nearestObstacle` over the *same* hulls
 * the walk used. That matters more than it looks: the optimiser will only
 * accept a shortcut that this predicate calls clear, so tidying can never
 * produce a route walkaround would have rejected. One notion of "blocked",
 * used by both halves.
