 * Cross-device sync over Supabase Realtime.
 *
 * The same `ProjectSyncTransport` the same-browser `BroadcastChannelTransport`
 * implements, so no editor knows which one it is talking to. Three things are
 * genuinely different here, and all three are consequences of there being a
 * server rather than choices:
 *
 * **Roles are read, not elected.** `BroadcastChannelTransport` has to invent an
 * owner (first peer to find nobody else present claims it) because a
 * same-browser channel has no authority to ask. Here `project_roster()` is that
 * authority: ownership is `projects.user_id` and membership is
 * `project_members`, both enforced by RLS. So there is no election, and a
 * `role-assign` is not an honour-system broadcast — it is a `setMemberRole`
 * call the server refuses unless the caller really is the owner.
 *
 * **Presence is per connection, not per account.** The presence key is
 * `peerId`, so somebody with the project open in two tabs is two peers, which
 * is what a cursor list has to show. Their role is the same in both, because
 * role is a fact about the account.
 *
 * **Nothing legible leaves the device.** Every payload body and the readable
 * half of every presence record is sealed under the project key first — see
 * `sync_crypto.ts` for what stays in the clear and why. This is the transport
 * that has a server in the middle, so it is the transport that needs it;
 * `BroadcastChannelTransport` deliberately has none, because a BroadcastChannel
 * never leaves the browser that opened it and encrypting a message to yourself
 * protects nobody.
 *
 * The rule that falls out of that: **without a key, this sends nothing at all.**
 * Not a cleartext fallback — a project whose key this account does not hold is
 * a project whose live traffic would otherwise be readable by the server, which
 * is the exact thing the encryption work was for. A keyless connection reports
 * an empty peer list and stays quiet, which the editor already copes with.
 *
 * Failure is not fatal, ever: multiplayer is additive (requirement 9 in
 * docs/proposals/multiplayer-architecture.md). If the channel never subscribes,
 * the roster cannot be read, or no key can be had, this reports an empty peer
 * list and the editor carries on exactly as it does with nobody else around. It
 * never blocks, refuses or delays an edit.
