/**
 * What the Route Single Track tool decides when the cursor moves.
 * Counterpart: `ROUTER_TOOL`'s posture, plus the walkaround run over it.
 *
 * This was the last untested link in the router chain. Hulls, chain operations,
 * walkaround and its driver each have a suite; the glue deciding *when* to use
 * them had none, because it lived in a `.tsx` the qa package cannot import.
 * That is exactly the seam where a chain of individually-correct pieces goes
 * wrong — the bug fixed in #372 survived two PRs in precisely that gap.
 *
 * The behaviour worth pinning is the **fallback**. When no clear route exists
 * the tool draws the direct path rather than nothing, and that has never been
 * asserted anywhere: a router that goes blank when the board gets tight is one
 * people stop trusting, and it would have failed silently.
